# JARVIS-Like Intelligence System

A modular and extensible framework for building real-time, adaptive intelligence systems. Inspired by fictional systems like JARVIS, this framework combines **context gathering**, **decision-making**, and **action execution** into a cohesive, highly customizable structure.

---

## Features
- **Contextual Awareness**:
  - Gathers real-time data from multiple sources (e.g., APIs, device states).
- **Dynamic Decision-Making**:
  - Combines rule-based logic and AI-driven insights for actionable recommendations.
- **Proactive Conversations**:
  - Engages in two-way interactions with the user, seeking approval for key decisions.
- **Modularity**:
  - Add or replace engines and decision units to suit any domain (e.g., IoT, finance, network management).
- **Scalability**:
  - Easily extendable for more complex use cases or additional integrations.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Contextual Engines**
Contextual engines gather data from various sources and provide structured information to decision-making units.

- **Example**: Fetching weather data, system stats, or smart home metrics.

### 2. **Decision-Making Units (DMUs)**
DMUs analyze the context to generate actionable insights or decisions.

- **Example**: 
  - Rule-Based: “Turn off non-essential devices if energy usage is high.”
  - AI-Powered: “Based on weather trends, suggest carrying an umbrella.”

### 3. **Action Executor**
The Action Executor takes decisions and executes them while enabling proactive user interaction.

- **Example**: 
  - Automatically dimming lights.
  - Sending alerts or reminders.

## Example Workflow

```plaintext
Starting JARVIS-like Intelligence System...

--- Gathering Context ---
Weather Context: {'weather': 'Rainy'}
System Context: {'cpu_usage': 40, 'memory_usage': 70}

--- Making Decisions ---
Basic Decision: Turn off non-essential devices
AI Decision: Energy usage is high. Dim the lights.

--- Executing Actions ---
Executing: Turn off non-essential devices
Proactive Alert: Energy usage is high. Dim the lights? (yes/no): yes
Action Confirmed: Dim the lights
Actions completed.

--- Executed Actions Log ---
Confirmed: Dim the lights
--- End of Log ---
```

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Customize Engines and Units**:
   - Modify or add new engines and decision-making units in their respective directories.
   - Update `main.py` to include your changes.

3. **Test Proactive Conversations**:
   - Interact with the system during execution for personalized decision-making.

## Extending the System

### Add a New Contextual Engine
1. Create a new file in the `context_engines/` directory (e.g., `network_engine.py`).
2. Implement a `run()` method that gathers and returns data.
3. Update `main.py` to include the new engine.

### Add a New Decision-Making Unit
1. Create a new file in the `decision_units/` directory (e.g., `network_dmu.py`).
2. Implement a `run(context)` method to analyze data and return decisions.
3. Update `main.py` to include the new DMU.

## Real-World Applications

- **Home Automation**:
  - Optimize smart home devices based on energy usage and weather conditions.
- **Network Management**:
  - Monitor device states and reroute traffic dynamically.
- **Financial Analytics**:
  - Analyze market trends and suggest portfolio adjustments.
